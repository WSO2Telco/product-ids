Introduction to WSO2.Telco

==========================



WSO2.Telco Inc., the brain child of a Telco group innovation team and WSO2 Inc., was set up to address the challenges global Telcos’ face staying relevant and competitive in Internet age. The WSO2.Telco digital enablement platform is an open source “internet enabling layer” based on the award winning WSO2 open source middleware technology.



Our technology is the most complete open source platform of its kind for MNOs combining API management, Identity Management, powerful service mapping, efficient orchestration, monetization and reporting with enterprise grade support. It represents a radical departure from the traditional proprietary software licensing / support model, is cloud, PaaS or on premise ready and is horizontally scalable.



Our mission is to continue to embrace and refine new operational concepts and tried and tested open source technologies to achieve scalability & speed to market - whilst eliminating opportunity cost & execution friction for our partners.



Introduction

============



The WSO2.Telco ID Gateway is a standalone solution capable of being the backbone of a fully integrated ID Strategy including SSO, federated ID services and more. The ID Gateway is currently the only fully featured open source GSMA certified ID solution. MNO’s can freely download this component and deploy Mobile Connect or build a PoC by carrying out integrations to their network elements. Further SPs and enterprises can use this solution to implement a federated ID solution for their own use.



For Mobile Connect the WSO2.Telco Identity solution consists of authenticators for Levels of Assurance 2 and 3 (LOA2, LOA3) including Header enrichment, SMS, USSD and Smartphone applications. The solution also works with third party SIM applets and is GSMA Mobile Connect, GSMA OneAPI V3 and ETSI 102.204 compliant.

1.  Deployment Guide

    ================



    1.  <span id="h.t8aryp41h4qg" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc447708357" class="anchor"></span></span>2.1 Environment and prerequisites

        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



-   WSO2 Telco Ids is Oracle JDK 1.6.\*/1.7.\* compliant. JDK 1.8 is not supported yet. Also OpenJDK is not recommended or supported.



-   It is recommended to use an LDAP like OpenLDAP for user managemente and not recommended to use Apache DS in a production environment due to issues with scalability.



<!-- -->



-   Hardware requirement per instance



  ----------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Physical          -   3 GHz Dual-core Xeon/Opteron (or latest)

                    

                    -   4 GB RAM (2 GB for JVM and 2 GB for the operating system)

                    

                    -   10 GB free disk space

                    

                    Disk space is based on the expected storage requirements that are calculated by considering the file uploads and the backup policies. For example, if three WSO2 product instances are running in a single machine, it requires a 4 GHz CPU, 8 GB RAM (2 GB for the operating system and 6 GB (2 GB for each WSO2 product instance)) and 30 GB of free space.



  Virtual Machine   -   2 compute units minimum (each unit having 1.0-1.2 GHz Opteron/Xeon processor)

                    

                    -   4 GB RAM

                    

                    -   10 GB free disk space

                    

                    -   One CPU unit for the operating system and one for JVM.

                    

                    Three WSO2 product instances running would require VM of 4 compute units, 8 GB RAM and 30 GB free space.



  EC2               -   1 c3.large instance to run one WSO2 product instance.

                    

                    Three WSO2 product instances can be run in 1 EC2 Extra-Large instance. Based on the I/O performance of the c3.large instance, it is recommended to run multiple instances in a larger instance (c3.xlarge or c3.2xlarge).

    ===========================================================================================================



    1.  Monitoring the server

        ---------------------



WSO2 Telco ids which is based on WSO2 identity server is a powerful framework for collecting statistical information.



Follow the instructions below to access the statistics feature.



1.  Sign in. Enter your user name and password to log on to the [Management Console].



2.  Navigate to the **Monitor** menu.



Components of the "Monitor" menu are described in the following topics:



-   [System Statistics]



The "**System statistics**" page shows certain statistics related to the WSO2 Identity Server instance. These include free memory, request count, server name, server start time, system up time, active services, total memory, average response time, minimum response time, and maximum response time.



For more information and how to access System Statistics, visit <https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS500/System+Statistics>



-   [System Logs]



The "**System Logs**" page displays information regarding the log files of the current product. Furthermore, it has a feature that allows the user to view and download log files according to their preference.



For more information and how to access System Logs, visit <https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS500/System+Logs>



-   [SOAP Tracer]



The "**SOAP Tracer**" shows SOAP messages, SOAP message requests, and SOAP message responses -- including when the services were deployed on the server and the operations invoked. By default, this feature is turned off. You have to turn it on to enable tracing.



Warning: Turning on the Tracer feature will negatively impact performance. This is because SOAP messages are always completely built (deferred building is not possible) and stored in the database by WSO2 Data Services. Hence, this option should be used with caution.



> For more information and how to access SOAP Tracer, visit <https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS500/SOAP+Tracer>



Performance tuning

------------------



To optimize network and OS performance, you can edit following files in linux systems. 

/etc/sysctl.conf

/etc/security/limits.conf



For more information, visit <https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Performance+Tuning+Recommendations>



**Change the Client ID and Client Secret of a created SP**



The admin service to be used is 'OAuthAdminService' (you can find the admin services as given in \[1\]).



You can use the operation 'registerOAuthApplicationData' in 'OAuthAdminService' to set ConsumerKey and ConsumerSecret.



To do this, use the attributes oauthConsumerKey and oauthConsumerSecret in OAuthConsumerAppDTO.



However, please note that \*before\* invoking 'OAuthAdminService', you need to have registered a Service Provider. To register a Service Provider, the service to use is 'IdentityApplicationManagementService'.

You may refer to the sample client attached herewith (sample\_client.zip), which shows how to set ConsumerKey and ConsumerSecret using the above admin service.\

Before building the sample, edit 'RelyingPartyAdder.java' file (located in sample\_client/src/main/java/org/wso2/carbon/relying/party/adder) as follows:



1\. Replace '/home/[~~AXIATAMIFEDEV-38~~]/wso2is-5.0.0' with the path to Identity Server Home in your environment.



2\. Update "javax.net.ssl.trustStore" property according to your environment.



3\. If you have changed the default admin username and password, make sure to update those parameters within the main method as well.\

(If you're using a fresh Identity Server pack, you can ignore points \#2 and \#3)
