WSO2 Identity Server is an open source Identity and Entitlement management server. It supports a wide array of authentication 
protocols such as SAML 2.0 Web SSO, OpenID, OAuth 2.0/1.0a, OpenID Connect and WS-Federation Passive. 
It supports role based authorization and fined grained authorization with XACML 2.0/3.0 while inbound/outbound provisioning is 
supported through SCIM and SPML.

This is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon framework. All the major features have been developed as pluggable Carbon components.

New Features
============

*   Workflow support for Identity Server

        Engage workflows for any user/role operations carried out using WSO2 IS Management Console.
        For example, when a new user gets registered with WSO2 IS, a workflow will automatically be triggered and
        s/he will be assigned to a particular user role.

*   FIDO compliance

    Fast Identity Online (FIDO) is a specification developed to reduce the reliance on password for user
    authentication. The standard will enable any Web/cloud application to interface with a variety of FIDO-enabled
    security devices.

*   Link multiple user accounts

    In cases where users will have multiple entries in their respective user stores, to avoid requiring multiple
    logins to an application to obtain a fully privileged view for a single user's details, we now support merging
    of multiple user profiles.

*   PATCH operation support for SCIM 1.1

    PUT supports the replace operation but not the update operation. Since group is a heavy resource, the
    operation that alters without replacement (PATCH) needs to be implemented. If not each time a new user is
    added to the group, all the users should be sent in the PUT request.</p>

*   SAML 2.0 Bearer Token Renewal

    In IS 5.0.0, STS feature supports renewing Bearer type SAML 1.1 tokens only;
    attempts to renew Bearer type SAML 2.0 Tokens get failed. With IS 5.2.0 product will
    facilitate renewing expired Bearer type SAML 2.0 Tokens.

*   OpenID Connect Core 1.0 Compliance

    The IS 5.0.0 had OpenID Support, however there were many points in the spec that were being violated.
    Now that the specification is finalized we have made IS OpenID Connect support specification
    compliant. A major improvement this area is support for IDToken response type from the
    OpenID Connect authorization endpoint.

*   Ability to notify external endpoints when changes are made to Identities</li>

    @product.name@ is now able to send invalidation notifications to external endpoints when there is a change in user
    roles, permissions or attributes as well as clear the internal cache when user roles, permissions or attributes
    been updated

*  Request Path Authenticators.
*  Social Login with Facebook / Google / Microsoft Windows Live.
*  Ability to plug-in custom developed authenticators.
*  Provisioning Bridge.
*  Just-in-time provisioning.</li>
*  Ability to plug-in custom developed provisioning connectors.
*  User Dashboard.
*  SAML2 Web SSO profile Request / Response validator.
*  Remote User Store Management.
*  Custom permissions.
*  Encrypted SAML2 Assertions.
*  NTLM grant type for OAuth 2.0
*  Workflows for user management operations

Secure sensitive information in carbon configuration files
----------------------------------------------------------

There are sensitive information such as passwords in the carbon configuration. 
You can secure them by using secure vault. Please go through following steps to 
secure them with default mode. 

1. Configure secure vault with default configurations by running ciphertool 
	script from bin directory.  

> ciphertool.sh -Dconfigure   (in UNIX)  

This script would do following configurations that you need to do by manually 

(i) Replaces sensitive elements in configuration files,  that have been defined in
		 cipher-tool.properties, with alias token values.  
(ii) Encrypts plain text password which is defined in cipher-text.properties file.
(iii) Updates secret-conf.properties file with default keystore and callback class. 

cipher-tool.properties, cipher-text.properties and secret-conf.properties files 
			can be found at repository/conf/security directory. 

2. Start server by running wso2server script from bin directory

> wso2server.sh   (in UNIX)

By default mode, it would ask you to enter the master password 
(By default, master password is the password of carbon keystore and private key) 

3. Change any password by running ciphertool script from bin directory.  

> ciphertool -Dchange  (in UNIX)
