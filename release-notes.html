<h1>@product.name@ : An Open Source Identity and Entitlement Management Server</h1>

<h3>@product.name@ v@product.version@ Release Note</h3>

<h3>10 Sept 2016</h3>

<p>
    The @product.name@ team is pleased to announce the release of version @product.version@ of
    the @product.name@ (IS).
</p>

<p>@product.name@ is an open source Identity and Entitlement management server. It supports a wide array of
    authentication
    protocols such as SAML 2.0 Web SSO, OpenID, OAuth 2.0/1.0a, OpenID Connect and WS-Federation Passive.
    It supports role based authorization and fined grained authorization with XACML 2.0/3.0 while inbound/outbound
    provisioning is
    supported through SCIM and SPML</p>

<p>
    @product.name@ is developed on top of the revolutionary
    <a href="http://wso2.com/products/carbon">WSO2 Carbon platform</a>,
    an OSGi based framework that provides seamless modularity to your SOA via
    componentization.</p>

<p>All the major features have been developed as pluggable Carbon components.</p>

<p>
    You can download this distribution from <a href="http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/">
    http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/</a>.</p>

<p>The online documentation is available at
    <a href="http://docs.wso2.org/wiki/display/IS510/WSO2+Identity+Server+Documentation">
        http://docs.wso2.org/wiki/display/IS510/WSO2+Identity+Server+Documentation.</a></p>

<h2>How to Run </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Extract the downloaded zip</li>
    <li>Go to the bin directory in the extracted folder</li>
    <li>Run the wso2server.sh or wso2server.bat as appropriate</li>
    <li>If you need to start the OSGi console with the server use the property
        -DosgiConsole when starting the server.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>New Features In This Release</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Workflow support for Identity Server</li>

    <p>Engage workflows for any user/role operations carried out using WSO2 IS Management Console.
        For example, when a new user gets registered with WSO2 IS, a workflow will automatically be triggered and
        s/he will be assigned to a particular user role.</p>

    <li>FIDO compliance</li>

    <p>Fast Identity Online (FIDO) is a specification developed to reduce the reliance on password
        for user authentication. The standard will enable any Web/cloud application to interface with a
        variety of FIDO-enabled security devices.</p>

    <li>Link multiple user accounts</li>

    <p>In cases where users will have multiple entries in their respective user stores, to avoid requiring multiple
        logins to an application to obtain a fully privileged view for a single user's details, we now support merging
        of multiple user profiles.</p>

    <li>PATCH operation support for SCIM 1.1</li>

    <p>PUT supports the replace operation but not the update operation. Since group is a heavy resource, the
        operation that alters without replacement (PATCH) needs to be implemented. If not each time a new user is
        added to the group, all the users should be sent in the PUT request.</p>

    <li>SAML 2.0 Bearer Token Renewal</li>

    <p>In IS 5.0.0, STS feature supports renewing Bearer type SAML 1.1 tokens only;
        attempts to renew Bearer type SAML 2.0 Tokens get failed. With IS 5.2.0 product will
        facilitate renewing expired Bearer type SAML 2.0 Tokens.</p>

    <li>OpenID Connect Core 1.0 Compliance</li>

    <p>The IS 5.0.0 had OpenID Support, however there were many points in the spec that were being violated.
        Now that the specification is finalized we have made IS 5.2.0 OpenID Connect support specification
        compliant. A major improvement this area is support for IDToken response type from the
        OpenID Connect authorization endpoint.</p>

    <li>Ability to notify external endpoints when changes are made to Identities</li>

    <p>@product.name@ is now able to send invalidation notifications to external endpoints when there is a change in user
        roles, permissions or attributes as well as clear the internal cache when user roles, permissions or attributes
        been updated</p>

</ul>
