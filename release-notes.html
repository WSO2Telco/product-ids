    <h1>WSO2Telco Mobile Identity Gateway 2.3.0 Released!</h1>

    <p>
        The WSO2Telco team is pleased to announce the release of version 2.3.0 of
        the Open Source WSO2Telco Mobile Identity Gateway.
    </p>

    <p>

        The WSO2.Telco Mobile Identity Gateway is a standalone solution capable of being the backbone of a fully
        integrated ID Strategy including SSO, federated
        ID services and more. The ID Gateway is currently the only fully featured open source GSMA certified ID
        solution. MNO's can freely download this component
        and deploy Mobile Connect or build a PoC by carrying out integrations to their network elements. Further SPs and
        enterprises can use this solution to implement
        a federated ID solution for their own use.

        For Mobile Connect the WSO2.Telco Identity solution consists of authenticators for Levels of Assurance 2 and 3
        (LOA2, LOA3) including Header enrichment, SMS,
        USSD and Smartphone applications. The solution also works with third party SIM applets and is GSMA Mobile
        Connect, GSMA OneAPI V3 and ETSI 102.204 compliant.

        This is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon framework. All the major features have been developed as
        pluggable Carbon components.
